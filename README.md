# I. Executive Summary

Fitness at Fiveâ€™s primary mission and goal is to connect with their members as much as possible and to harness a tight knit community within their gym. They want to capitalize on the small size of their gym by reinforcing their relationships with existing members as opposed to trying to make the gym as large as possible and grow in size. Their main issue is that they have limited means of communication with their members and they want to expand their horizons. Our solution is to create a wireframe to streamline the process of app development by creating a foundation for them. In turn, this should also aid in more effective price negotiation with their future app developers.   

# II. Project Description / Business Case

## Background

Fitness @ Five is an independent small business started in the summer of 2010. Both locally owned and operated they provide an all access, 24/7 experience for all their members. The main goal of Fitness @ Five is not only to help clients achieve their fitness goals but create a welcoming community This small business is determined to make members feel comfortable and connected with each client being on a first-name basis, ultimately creating a close-knit community. Their belief in their community is strong and they have no long term contracts, only month-to-month memberships. Fitness @ Five is its own little family. 

## Description of Challange or Opportunity

Fitness at Five has yet to have an app for the gym. Most of their attempts to facilitate an app launch have failed due to the high cost charge and lack of expertise on their current staff to create one. They lack the staffing and knowledge of app development meaning the creation of an app from scratch is rather costly.

## Overview of Desired Impact

Creating a wireframe for them could streamline the process of launching an app and cut the overall cost. They could negotiate a better price with a hired person to develop the app as the wireframe covers half of the work. This wireframe will serve as a blueprint to create a multifunctional app that members can use to track their membership, connect with trainers, and even have virtual training session videos for an additional charge on the app. The app should help facilitate connections between trainers and members, provide a more accessible way to track membership and membership payments, and bring in an additional source of revenue for the gym through the virtual training sessions.
