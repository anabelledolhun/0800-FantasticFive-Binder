# I. Executive Summary

Fitness at Five’s primary mission and goal is to connect with their members as much as possible and to harness a tight knit community within their gym. They want to capitalize on the small size of their gym by reinforcing their relationships with existing members as opposed to trying to make the gym as large as possible and grow in size. Their main issue is that they have limited means of communication with their members and they want to expand their horizons. Our solution is to create a wireframe to streamline the process of app development by creating a foundation for them. In turn, this should also aid in more effective price negotiation with their future app developers.   

# II. Project Description / Business Case

## Background

Fitness @ Five is an independent small business started in the summer of 2010. Both locally owned and operated they provide an all access, 24/7 experience for all their members. The main goal of Fitness @ Five is not only to help clients achieve their fitness goals but create a welcoming community This small business is determined to make members feel comfortable and connected with each client being on a first-name basis, ultimately creating a close-knit community. Their belief in their community is strong and they have no long term contracts, only month-to-month memberships. Fitness @ Five is its own little family. 

## Description of Challange or Opportunity

Fitness at Five has yet to have an app for the gym. Most of their attempts to facilitate an app launch have failed due to the high cost charge and lack of expertise on their current staff to create one. They lack the staffing and knowledge of app development meaning the creation of an app from scratch is rather costly.

## Overview of Desired Impact

Creating a wireframe for them could streamline the process of launching an app and cut the overall cost. They could negotiate a better price with a hired person to develop the app as the wireframe covers half of the work. This wireframe will serve as a blueprint to create a multifunctional app that members can use to track their membership, connect with trainers, and even have virtual training session videos for an additional charge on the app. The app should help facilitate connections between trainers and members, provide a more accessible way to track membership and membership payments, and bring in an additional source of revenue for the gym through the virtual training sessions.

# III. Project Scope

## Scope Statement

We will create wireframes to enhance member experience, streamline gym operations, and reduce app development costs. Creating wireframes that outline the app’s UI design will allow the gym to reduce the complexity of development when hiring an outside team to create the app.

***MoSCoW Model in the Appendices*** 

# IV. Measurable Organizational Impact 

Our wireframe model will help Fitness @ Five explore the benefits of a potential app by showcasing key features like a scheduling tool and interactive workout videos. The scheduling tool would allow members to book personal training sessions directly, reducing administrative tasks, minimizing scheduling conflicts, and improving convenience. Workout videos would extend the gym’s reach, keeping members engaged outside the facility, increasing retention, and enhancing brand loyalty.

This project does not involve app development but provides a structured roadmap, helping Fitness @ Five understand how digital tools can streamline operations, improve member satisfaction, and position the gym as a modern, tech-savvy facility. Additionally, by outlining the app’s layout and features, our model can reduce development costs by giving the gym a clear vision, allowing for more efficient planning and investment in future digital solutions.

  ## VI.II Change Management Plan

Our team will manage changes through a structured Change Management Plan to ensure transparency, alignment, and documentation of all modifications. Any suggested changes, whether proposed by a team member or the sponsor, will be discussed in a group meeting. During this meeting, we will evaluate the components of the change and determine its impact on the project. A group vote will be conducted, and if the majority supports the change, it will be affirmed.

Additionally, we will maintain open communication with the sponsor regarding any necessary changes. If the sponsor suggests a change, our team will follow the same decision-making process stated above to assess and approve the modification. All agreed-upon changes will be recorded in the change log (reference the section that the change log is on here) to track adjustments and maintain accountability throughout the project.


## VI.III Issue Management Plan

  Our team will manage project issues through a structured Issue Management Plan to ensure timely identification, discussion, and resolution. When an issue arises, the group will convene to assess the situation, gather relevant details, and discuss potential solutions. Team members will provide suggestions on the most effective and efficient way to resolve the issue, ensuring that all perspectives are considered.

  If necessary, we will communicate with the sponsor to provide details on the severity and facts of the issue. Should the sponsor bring forth an issue, our team will follow the same process—analyzing the problem, identifying areas of weakness, and collaboratively working toward a swift resolution. All efforts will be made to address issues in a timely manner to minimize any disruption to the project’s progress.

  To maintain accountability and track recurring challenges, all issues will be documented in the issue log (reference the section the issue log is on here). This log will serve as a record of identified issues, actions taken, and resolutions, ensuring transparency and continuous improvement throughout the project.

# XI. Project Handoff

We will start by demonstrating how to use the wireframe. We plan to do multiple run throughs. In the first run through, we will simply demonstrate its use from a user perspective. We will then conduct a second demonstration and explain the features as we use it. We will then explain to them how this wireframe should allow them to negotiate a better price for future app developers as they already have this design in place. At this point we will ask them to demonstrate it to us to make sure it can function correctly without our help. Once they have successfully completed the demonstration we will pitch different app development platforms and state the pros and cons for each one. This way when they hire an app developer, they have a deeper understanding of the different platforms and a more effective negotiation experience. We are going to allocate at least a week for this phase as it proves to be the most crucial. This will allow them to ask any questions before the project commences and we leave for summer.

## A. MoSCoW Model

Must (M): 
User Accounts: It is essential to be able to create and login to an account in order for members and trainers to use the app. The wireframe should detail how this can be achieved. 
Membership Management: this is critical for members so they can manage their subscriptions (as it is month to month), make payments, and view their past payment history. This will tie in to the revenue model so it is essential to the project. 
Virtual Training Sessions: Since this is our new key feature of the app, and the key feature that will provide revenue it is a priority. Both live and on-demand videos will be provided on the app, so the wireframe must be very detailed for this particular feature. 

Should (S):
Trainer Profiles: This is important as it helps clients make a connection with their trainer. It can be postponed as other functionalities such as revenue streams should be dealt with first, but it is definitely still an important aspect since the gym focuses on cultivating that personal experience. 
Progress Tracking: Members being able to track their progress could be a feature that comes in handy, or could be added in the future version of the app in order to focus on the main features. 
Push Notifications: This will ensure continued engagement with the app but is not fundamental for the launch of the app. 
Cross-Platform Development: Although the app should be available both on iOS and Android, with the limited time it may not be possible to ensure that. As most users of the gym are iOS users, found through surveys taken at the gym, that will be the main focus during wireframe development. 
o   Out of Scope 

Could ( C )
Multilingual Support: This would be useful for diversifying members and expanding the reach of the app. However it is not essential for the initial version nor essential for creating the initial wireframe. 
Creating the App: Creating the app cannot fit in the timeframe or budget we have on this project. Wireframes to make an app will be created instead so that the gym can then hire a team from there. 

Won’t (W)
Social Media Integration: As this app is focusing more on direct relationships with members and trainers it will not be necessary to build the social functions of the app out (such as messaging other members, or posting progress pictures).
Integration with 3rd Party Device: Many gym users use fitbits or apple watches. As it would be interesting to design an app that is functional for both the main functions including workout videos
