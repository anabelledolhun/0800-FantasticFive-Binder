# I. Executive Summary

Fitness at Five’s primary mission and goal is to connect with their members as much as possible and to harness a tight knit community within their gym. They want to capitalize on the small size of their gym by reinforcing their relationships with existing members as opposed to trying to make the gym as large as possible and grow in size. Their main issue is that they have limited means of communication with their members and they want to expand their horizons. Our solution is to create a wireframe to streamline the process of app development by creating a foundation for them. In turn, this should also aid in more effective price negotiation with their future app developers.   

# II. Project Description / Business Case

## Background

Fitness at Five is an independent small business started in the summer of 2010. Both locally owned and operated they provide an all access, 24/7 experience for all their members. The main goal of Fitness at Five is not only to help clients achieve their fitness goals but create a welcoming community This small business is determined to make members feel comfortable and connected with each client being on a first-name basis, ultimately creating a close-knit community. Their belief in their community is strong and they have no long term contracts, only month-to-month memberships. 

## Description of Challange or Opportunity

Fitness at Five has yet to have an app for the gym. Most of their attempts to facilitate an app launch have failed due to the high cost charge and lack of expertise on their current staff to create one. They lack the staffing and knowledge of app development meaning the creation of an app from scratch is rather costly.

## Overview of Desired Impact

Creating a wireframe for them will streamline the process of launching an app and cut the overall cost. They can negotiate a better price with a hired person to develop the app as the wireframe accounts for major phases and lays the foundation for app development. This wireframe will serve as a blueprint to create a multifunctional app that members can use to track their membership, connect with trainers, and even have virtual training session videos for an additional charge on the app. The app will also help facilitate connections between trainers and members, provide a more accessible way to track membership and membership payments, and bring in an additional source of revenue for the gym through the virtual training sessions.

# III. Project Scope

## Scope Statement

"We will create wireframes to enhance member experience, streamline gym operations, and reduce app development costs. Creating wireframes that outline the app’s UI design will allow the gym to reduce the complexity of development when hiring an outside team to create the app."

*MoSCoW Model in the Appendices (XIV.A)*

# IV. Measurable Organizational Impact 

Our wireframe model will help Fitness @ Five explore the benefits of a potential app by showcasing key features like a scheduling tool and interactive workout videos. The scheduling tool would allow members to book personal training sessions directly, reducing administrative tasks, minimizing scheduling conflicts, and improving convenience. Workout videos would extend the gym’s reach, keeping members engaged outside the facility, increasing retention, and provide an additional revenue stream from the added subscription.

This project does not involve app development but provides a structured roadmap, helping Fitness @ Five understand how digital tools can streamline operations, improve member satisfaction, and position the gym as a modern, tech-savvy facility. Additionally, by outlining the app’s layout and features, our model can reduce development costs by giving the gym a clear vision, allowing for more efficient planning and investment in future digital solutions.

  ### Risk Log

*The Risk Log is found in the Appendices (XIV.B)*

## Change Management Plan

Our team will manage changes through a structured Change Management Plan to ensure transparency, alignment, and documentation of all modifications. Any suggested changes, whether proposed by a team member or the sponsor, will be discussed in a group meeting. During this meeting, we will evaluate the components of the change and determine its impact on the project. A group vote will be conducted, and if the majority supports the change, it will be affirmed.

Additionally, we will maintain open communication with the sponsor regarding any necessary changes. If the sponsor suggests a change, our team will follow the same decision-making process stated above to assess and approve the modification. All agreed-upon changes will be recorded in the change log to track adjustments and maintain accountability throughout the project.

*The Change log is found in the Appendices (XIV.C)*

## Issue Management Plan

  Our team will manage project issues through a structured Issue Management Plan to ensure timely identification, discussion, and resolution. When an issue arises, the group will convene to assess the situation, gather relevant details, and discuss potential solutions. Team members will provide suggestions on the most effective and efficient way to resolve the issue, ensuring that all perspectives are considered.

  If necessary, we will communicate with the sponsor to provide details on the severity and facts of the issue. Should the sponsor bring forth an issue, our team will follow the same process—analyzing the problem, identifying areas of weakness, and collaboratively working toward a swift resolution. All efforts will be made to address issues in a timely manner to minimize any disruption to the project’s progress.

  To maintain accountability and track recurring challenges, all issues will be documented in the issue log. This log will serve as a record of identified issues, actions taken, and resolutions, ensuring transparency and continuous improvement throughout the project.

*The Issue log is found in the Appendices (XIV.D)*

## Quality Management Plan

The 3 quality criteria for our projectt: 

#### 1. Usability
Usability includes the wireframe being as intuitive for the user as possible, reflecting the key features outlined in the scope, including account management, membership tracking, and access to virtual training. 

#### 2. Functionality
Functionality includes providing enough detail in the wireframe for app developers to be able to logically structure the plans without any ambiguity or confusion. This includes the flow between pages of the wireframe are clear, which leads into consistency. 


#### 3. Consistency
The wireframe design needs to be consistent in design, and functionality across all components. 

#### How will we achieve this?

Ensuring we manage a high quality project throughout we have a series of processes that we will conduct throughout the lifecycle of the project. This includes gathering stakeholder input to make sure our wireframe aligns with their vision and goals for the app. Mockups of the wireframe will be continuously made and then checked over by the team to validate each key function of the app. This will help check quality at every stage ensuring each deliverable is up to standard. User testing may not be possible due to time restraints, but constant communication with the gym will allow us to assess which components our clients value the most. 

Regular collaborative feedback from the team while designing the wireframe will help with any discrepancies in the project. Furthermore quality checks during milestones in the project can further improve overall quality. At the end of wireframe development a final review meeting will be conducted to see whether all quality criteria (usability, functionality, and consistency) are met. The meeting will also include a presentation of the wireframe to the stakeholders (and possibly testers depending on Fitness @ Five), and if the majority of the team members and stakeholders are satisfied with the quality of the wireframe, the deliverable will then be approved. 

# VII. Project Schedule Summary

### Schedule Overview
### Estimated Project Completion: 4/20/2025

| Major Milestones| Estimated Date of Completion |
| ----------| ------  |
| Phase 1 | 02/25/2025  |
| Phase 2 | 03/18/2025  |
| Phase 3 |  04/07/2025 |

### Impact of Late Delivery
Late delivery could cause them to not be able to have an app as we are leaving for summer. Classes commence on the due date and therefore our team is no longer together to work on the project. They would not have a wireframe for their app which would prolong their progress towards implementing an app for the gym and remain at a very high cost to make one.

*Template used: Statement+of+Work, 'Schedule Overview' section*

# VII. Resources Required

Throughout the completion of our project, we utilized several key resources. In terms of people, our entire team collaborated closely to contribute ideas and complete tasks. We also received valuable guidance and feedback from our professor, Dr. Huber, and worked directly with Tony, the owner of the local gym and our project sponsor, to gather requirements and share updates.

For technology, we relied on Zoom to hold virtual team meetings and stay connected when in-person meetings were not possible. We used Figma to design and develop our wireframe for the potential gym app, and Canva to create a professional PowerPoint presentation to communicate our ideas effectively.
Our team made use of physical facilities such as our classroom, where we conducted regular in-class discussions and planning sessions. Additionally, we visited the gym to meet with Tony, which allowed us to better understand the environment and tailor our wireframe to the gym’s specific needs.

Other resources included our laptops and personal devices, which were essential for accessing the design platforms and communication tools. We also referenced different online tools and websites to search for a suitable development tool that would best support the creation of a gym-focused app.

# X. Design Documentation and Discussion 

## Design of our Wireframe

The basic design of our wireframe is displayed below in the image. 

![wireframes_image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f126d84-bbb7-4333-9016-bb9ca3110f7d)

In terms of design approach, our main goal was to create an inclusive UI. We aimed for our design to be consistent with the branding of the gym therefore giving the user a sense of familiarity. Considering that the gym clientele extends across any and all demographics, we wanted to ensure that any individual would feel comfortable navigating the platform. Therefore, we prioritized a clean, clear, and simple design. For sponsor needs, we placed a focal point on all of the key features we had discussed previously.

# XI. Implementation

## Strategy

- Implement an iterative development approach, where wireframes are developed in stages, with regular feedback from Tony.
- We are also aiming to be as detail-oriented as possible to provide a thorough explanation.

## Challanges

- The project has a short turnaround time, which may limit the depth of user testing and refinement.
- Lack of in-house expertise could slow down implementation as a more detailed explanation is needed.
- Ensuring the wireframe is adaptable for both iOS and Android platforms in the future, despite initial focus on iOS.

## Solutions

- We will allocate a sufficient amount of time for the implementation phase.
- We will use a scalable design to create a wireframe that is easily adaptable for future Android development.
- We will perform user testing on a smaller number of members including Anabelle's membership to ensure functionality prior to the
 
## Required Follow-up Actions

- Conduct stakeholder review meetings with the staff to ensure alignment and gather feedback.
- We will provide on sight support to answer any questions after implementation. 
 

# XII. Project Handover

We will start by demonstrating how to use the wireframe. We plan to do multiple run throughs. In the first run through, we will simply demonstrate its use from a user perspective. We will then conduct a second demonstration and explain the features as we use it. We will then explain to them how this wireframe should allow them to negotiate a better price for future app developers as they already have this design in place. At this point we will ask them to demonstrate it to us to make sure it can function correctly without our help. Once they have successfully completed the demonstration we will pitch different app development platforms and state the pros and cons for each one. This way when they hire an app developer, they have a deeper understanding of the different platforms and a more effective negotiation experience. We are going to allocate at least a week for this phase as it proves to be the most crucial. This will allow them to ask any questions before the project commences and we leave for summer. 

# XIII. Individual Reflections

### Anabelle
This project taught me valuable lessons on a personal and professional level. My experience was not just about working with a team, but also how to interact and work with a client. Prior to this project, I had little experience working with a real business and producing a project to provide value for it. I had worked for companies as an employee, but I had not been put in the position of having them as a client. As a result, the project seemed rather daunting to initiate and pitch our idea to them in the beginning. However, after I broke the ice and pitched the project it was very motivating to see their excitement and the value that we could provide for their business. This taught me the importance of taking action despite being intimidated which ultimately gave me the opportunity to improve my professional communication skills.  

I learned valuable lessons on how to be flexible and adapt to other people’s schedules through this project. We inevitably faced difficulty in scheduling meetings as the team is composed of five college students. This issue was further enhanced as we also needed to allocate time with our sponsor. As a result, I found that a high degree of adaptability was needed in order to get the project done in a timely manner. Instead of giving up and waiting until we could all meet in person, we had to come up with other ways to meet using platforms such as zoom. Otherwise, we would not have been able to accomplish what we did and would cause the project to lack cohesiveness. This showed me how important it is to be able to compromise with one another and adapt to different ways of working. 

We initially pitched an app to our sponsor, Tony. However, as we began the research process we knew that a wireframe was more feasible for our time and budget. We knew that we needed to change the scope to a wireframe but Tony’s excitement about an app was so rewarding that we felt as if we were letting him down. This implemented a sense of stubbornness in us and it took us quite some time to admit we needed to limit the scope to a wireframe. As a result, we experienced scope grope changing the scope constantly which caused further delay for phase 3 of our project. This in itself taught me the importance of managing expectation with stakeholders to avoid this sense of guilt. It also taught me the importance of making estimates in the beginning and being more realistic in what can actually get accomplished given time and budget. 

In the end, this project taught me skills that can only be learned through hands on experience which is what makes it so valuable. Working with a client granted me a new sense of confidence in my ability to communicate in the professional world. It also taught me how to facilitate communication with a team and alternative ways to work together when the circumstances are not ideal. 

### Tyler

In hindsight, this project has been one of, if not the, most valuable assignments I’ve been tasked with as a student. It has served as a valuable and relevant learning experience, providing real-world project management exposure. It truly did feel as if this project was the application of everything we’ve learned as MIS students thus far. 
There was no shortage of lessons learned throughout this project, especially in regards to teamwork. First and foremost, although cliche, communication is key, and input matters. Oftentimes, we had our own respective understandings of what our scope demanded. For example, my initial wireframes, which more closely resembled a social media app than a trainer-client focused app, were indicative of scope creep. However, due to our consistent communication as a group, that issue was quickly resolved and we re-aligned to our original scope. Secondly, the best followers make for even better leaders. By being an effective follower, one can truly “lead from behind” and inspire a vision.  
In terms of project management, this project allowed us to put all the relevant concepts, techniques, and tools that we have learned throughout this course into practice. One of my key takeaways from this project is that structure is a necessary benefit. At times, as mentioned before, our group had conflicting ideas on what our scope demanded. However, because we were able to reference tools like our MoSCoW model, risks were often entirely avoided. 
	When it comes to creating, especially for a client, it’s supremely important to build something that you’re proud of. All too often, we, as students, are assigned with “cookie-cutter” rubrics, entirely void of any opportunity for individuality. Realistically, this is one of the only assignments throughout my education that has not only given me the opportunity to, but has inspired me to apply myself. For example, with regards to the wireframes and UI design, I was able to leverage a passionate skill of mine in order to help our project meet its requirements. Furthermore, working with a client that has a vested interest in our finished product served as a valuable motive throughout the process. 

### Grayson

Throughout the completion of our semester-long project I have learned many valuable lessons that have enhanced my professional skills. One area I significantly improved upon was collaborating effectively with my team members. We maintained consistent and open communication throughout the project, regularly providing each other with constructive feedback to ensure we delivered the best possible outcome. This experience has helped prepare me for future roles in collaborative environments that require continuous coordination and teamwork. 

Additionally, I applied several key project management principles throughout the project. We applied due dates and timelines to our activities to ensure each activity would be completed in a timely manner to adhere to our project schedule. As I already mentioned, I maintained clear and constant communication with my group members so we could all be up to date with the status of the project and ready for next steps. I was accountable for working through the specific risks to our project, and this provided me with experience as to what risks would look like on a project level. Being able to identify and mitigate risks is a major part of any successful project, which will help me to be able to better understand and identify risks to projects I work on in the future.

Overall, there are many lessons that I have learned throughout the completion of our project that will add significant value to my personal and professional development. I’ve gained real-world experience working closely with peers, applying project management techniques, and engaging with a real client. One improvement I would suggest for future semesters is to provide the project binder template earlier. We struggled in the beginning to collect our ideas and findings in a centralized manner, until the binder template was released. If the template is provided earlier in the semester it would help teams to know exactly what they should be working towards and achieving with their findings. Ultimately, this project has strengthened both my teamwork and project management skills and better equipped me to contribute to future projects. 

### Krutee 

When talking about project management it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that it’s a straightforward skill to come by. As I would come to class and learn about different models, I often thought to myself that it seems simple enough to implement. For example, the outcome model, it felt intuitive to think about my desired state and work backwards from there. 
	
However, as we created our groups and started working, things were more complicated than I had first deemed. The catch with big projects is you will be working with a team of people who bring different backgrounds, personalities, cognitive frames, and goals to the table. I quickly learned that even though my desired outcome was clear in my head, everyone else had a slightly different version of what success in our project looked like to them. This conflict carried into many of our plans. A constant back and forth between what would serve us best in our project, what is the most efficient way to solve issues, and what would deliver the most value to our client. 
	
 At first aligning our visions and making space for everyone’s ideas was difficult. But as time went on our communication skills improved, and the project began to reflect the strengths of our entire team. My entire perspective shifted, and I realized multiple cognitive frames can enrich rather than complicate the process. 
	
Overall, the biggest lesson I learned is that while one person can produce something great, it’s through the integration of diverse perspectives and personalities that one can create a truly lasting impact. Our team is so proud of our end product because it represents a collective effort. I plan to take these skills with me into the professional world, especially the ability to navigate different perspectives with empathy and clarity, because meaningful collaboration is essential in any workplace. 

### Hazel

Throughout the completion of our semester-long project, I have learned many valuable lessons that have enhanced my professional skills. One area I significantly improved upon was collaborating effectively with team members who had different schedules, perspectives, and ideas. Despite these challenges, we maintained consistent and open communication, actively listening to one another and providing constructive feedback to ensure we delivered the best possible outcome. When a teammate struggled, we rallied together to offer support, reinforcing the importance of collective problem-solving. This experience has prepared me for future roles in collaborative environments where adaptability and teamwork are essential.

Additionally, I applied key project management principles, such as using binders, defining scope, and creating matrices to organize our work. At first glance, these frameworks seemed straightforward, but I quickly realized how challenging it was to apply them to a real business context. Documenting processes, aligning deliverables with client needs, and maintaining clarity in our matrices required more nuance than I expected. However, these management strategies proved invaluable—they kept our team structured, ensured accountability, and helped us avoid scope creep. We set clear due dates and timelines, and through constant communication, we stayed updated on progress and adjusted as needed. I also took ownership of identifying risks, such as delays in client feedback or resource limitations, which taught me how to proactively address challenges in future projects.

Working with an actual client added another layer of professionalism to the project. Presenting ideas, incorporating their feedback, and delivering a tangible output required us to balance creativity with practicality. Unlike hypothetical classroom assignments, this project demanded real-world accountability, teaching me how to navigate client expectations while maintaining a polished and professional approach.

Overall, this project has significantly contributed to my growth. I’ve gained hands-on experience in teamwork, project management tools, and client relations as well as how to present professionally. I would like to appreciate my teammates who helped me alot with the language barrier and understanding the principle of project management. 

# XIV. Appendices 
## A. MoSCoW Model

Must (M): 
User Accounts: It is essential to be able to create and login to an account in order for members and trainers to use the app. The wireframe should detail how this can be achieved. 
Membership Management: this is critical for members so they can manage their subscriptions (as it is month to month), make payments, and view their past payment history. This will tie in to the revenue model so it is essential to the project. 
Virtual Training Sessions: Since this is our new key feature of the app, and the key feature that will provide revenue it is a priority. Both live and on-demand videos will be provided on the app, so the wireframe must be very detailed for this particular feature. 

Should (S):
Trainer Profiles: This is important as it helps clients make a connection with their trainer. It can be postponed as other functionalities such as revenue streams should be dealt with first, but it is definitely still an important aspect since the gym focuses on cultivating that personal experience. 
Progress Tracking: Members being able to track their progress could be a feature that comes in handy, or could be added in the future version of the app in order to focus on the main features. 
Push Notifications: This will ensure continued engagement with the app but is not fundamental for the launch of the app. 
Cross-Platform Development: Although the app should be available both on iOS and Android, with the limited time it may not be possible to ensure that. As most users of the gym are iOS users, found through surveys taken at the gym, that will be the main focus during wireframe development. 
o   Out of Scope 

Could ( C )
Multilingual Support: This would be useful for diversifying members and expanding the reach of the app. However it is not essential for the initial version nor essential for creating the initial wireframe. 
Creating the App: Creating the app cannot fit in the timeframe or budget we have on this project. Wireframes to make an app will be created instead so that the gym can then hire a team from there. 

Won’t (W)
Social Media Integration: As this app is focusing more on direct relationships with members and trainers it will not be necessary to build the social functions of the app out (such as messaging other members, or posting progress pictures).
Integration with 3rd Party Device: Many gym users use fitbits or apple watches. As it would be interesting to design an app that is functional for both the main functions including workout videos

Anabelle- In my SQL group project, one of the group members encouraged us to use ChatGPT for all of the code, but I ended up deciding against that as it goes against the ethics and integrity of the project and we were specifically only to use it for data generation. The rest of the group members and I made sure he did his contribution without using that platform. 
 
Work Ethic
Grayson- Last summer internship, he was always on top of tasks and his boss was appreciative of his work ethic. For example, his boss would say things such as, “you complete things faster than I come up with things” 

Competence
Anabelle- In my internship, I had adequate Excel skills and knowledge to perform the tasks I was assigned and to complete the project in a more timely manner. 

Honesty
Tyler- He accidentally broke a piece of furniture at his job with a furniture company. He was honest about it and told the customer what happened. He made an effort to stay true to his employer’s philosophy of client honesty.

Courage
Anabelle- in my internship, I was specifically asked to manually enter hundreds and hundreds of oil parts by hand into a spreadsheet as opposed to using formulas. I had the courage to consult my supervisor and suggest another method with Excel formulas to achieve the same outcome.  

Discretion
Tyler- At the tennis store he worked at, the store had a big discount going on, but management said not to tell anyone about it. In response, he made sure to not tell customers even if they asked about it. 

Loyalty
Hazel- She committed to a job offer and received another offer that had a higher pay. However, she stayed loyal to her original offer. 

Ego Management
Tyler- In his BPMN group project, when the other members were not contributing a fair share, he had to set his ego aside and do the work instead of causing an argument with the other members to help him more.
