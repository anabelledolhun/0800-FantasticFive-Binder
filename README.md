# I. Executive Summary

Fitness at Fiveâ€™s primary mission and goal is to connect with their members as much as possible and to harness a tight knit community within their gym. They want to capitalize on the small size of their gym by reinforcing their relationships with existing members as opposed to trying to make the gym as large as possible and grow in size. Their main issue is that they have limited means of communication with their members and they want to expand their horizons. Our solution is to create a wireframe to streamline the process of app development by creating a foundation for them. In turn, this should also aid in more effective price negotiation with their future app developers.
